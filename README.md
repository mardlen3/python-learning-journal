import math            # connect the built-in library to use mathematical operations
side = eval(input('Enter the side of pentagon:'))   # declare a variable to save the value entered by the user
area = (5*math.pow(side,2))/(4*math.tan(math.pi/5))  # perform calculations
print("The area of the pentagon is:", format(area,".2f"))  # print the result
